## tutorial project

<p>
with this first project we where shown how to make a program using the 
os and the datetime which is from the python standard library.

the object was to take the basic file name "a.txt" and make it read 
"a-6-Tuesday.txt"

this involve creating a dictory and grabing file names using the os lib
then inside a for loop looping thur all the files inside the folder and 
gather the amount of words from each file.

then using the datetime lib getting the current date in converting datetime.now
with the " strftime(%A)" which do some googling to get the special chars 
for the datetime lib.

then putting it all together in a new file var using a f str

after all that we would have to write a line of code using the os rename 
funciton using the old file name to the new file name

then printing out a statement saying that the old file name is changed to 
new file name
